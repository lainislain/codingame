INPUT
numberOfCells: 37
index: 0 is the center cell, the next cells spiral outwards
richness: 0 if the cell is unusable, 1-3 for usable cells
neigh0: the index of the neighbouring cell for each direction
day: the game lasts 24 days: 0-23
nutrients: the base score you gain from the next COMPLETE action
sun: your sun points
score: your current score
oppSun: opponent's sun points
oppScore: opponent's score
oppIsWaiting: whether your opponent is asleep until the next day
numberOfTrees: the current amount of trees
cellIndex: location of this tree
size: size of this tree: 0-3
isMine: 1 if this is your tree
isDormant: 1 if this tree is dormant
numberOfPossibleActions: all legal actions
possibleAction: try printing something from here to start with

OUTPUT
GROW cellIdx | SEED sourceIdx targetIdx | COMPLETE cellIdx | WAIT <message>
